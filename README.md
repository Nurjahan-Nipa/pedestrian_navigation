## Project Overview
Large academic buildings such as Patrick F. Taylor Hall (PFT) at Louisiana State University pose significant navigation challenges for students, visitors, and staff. Complex layouts, unclear signage, and limited indoor navigation support often result in confusion, wasted time, and increased stress—particularly for first-time users or during time-sensitive situations.

This project explores the design of a **user-centered indoor navigation system** for PFT that supports efficient, accessible, and low-cognitive-load wayfinding. The long-term goal is to design an interactive navigation solution grounded in real user needs rather than purely technical accuracy.

## Problem Statement
The core problem addressed in this project is the difficulty users face when navigating inside large, multi-floor academic buildings. Existing solutions such as static floor maps, physical signage, or outdoor navigation tools do not adequately support indoor wayfinding. These solutions lack interactivity, real-time guidance, and contextual awareness, which are crucial for indoor environments.

Our team aims to understand how different users experience navigation challenges inside PFT and identify opportunities for designing an intuitive and usable navigation system tailored to an academic setting.

## Formative Study

### Instrument
We conducted a **formative study using semi-structured interviews** to understand users’ experiences, challenges, and strategies related to indoor navigation in academic buildings.

### Participants
- Number of participants: 5–7
- Participant groups included:
  - Undergraduate students
  - Graduate students
  - First-time visitors to PFT
- Collected demographic and background information included:
  - Age range
  - Education level
  - Familiarity with PFT
  - Comfort with mobile and navigation technologies

### Procedure
Each interview lasted approximately 15–25 minutes and was conducted either in person or online. Participants were asked about:
- Past experiences navigating PFT or similar buildings
- Specific challenges they encountered
- Strategies they currently use to find locations
- Features they wish existed to make navigation easier

Participation was voluntary, and no monetary compensation was provided.

### Data Collection and Analysis
Interview responses were documented through written notes and transcripts. The data was analyzed using **thematic analysis**, involving:
1. Initial coding of responses
2. Grouping related observations
3. Identifying recurring themes and patterns

### Results
Key themes that emerged from the analysis include:
- Difficulty locating rooms and offices due to unclear signage
- Confusion when navigating between floors
- Reliance on asking others for directions
- Increased stress when navigating under time pressure
- Desire for clear, step-by-step guidance and visual cues

These findings directly informed the creation of user personas and task examples.

## Personas

Based on the formative study, we developed two primary user personas:

1. **First-Year Undergraduate Student**
   - Limited familiarity with PFT
   - High time pressure between classes
   - Relies heavily on mobile technology

2. **Visiting Graduate Student / Researcher**
   - Unfamiliar with building layout
   - Needs to locate offices or meeting rooms
   - Values clear, efficient navigation without needing assistance

Each persona includes goals, frustrations, behaviors, and technology usage patterns to guide future design decisions.

---

## Task Examples

The following system-independent task examples were derived from the personas:

- **Task 1:** A first-year student needs to locate an unfamiliar classroom in PFT within 10 minutes before class begins.
- **Task 2:** A visiting researcher must find a faculty office on another floor without asking for help.

These tasks represent distinct navigation scenarios that the future system should support.

## Team Participation
Each team member contributed to the project as follows:
- Interview design and data collection
- Data analysis and synthesis
- Persona creation
- Writing and editing of the report

Individual contributions are detailed in the submitted report as required by the course guidelines.

## Status
This repository currently supports **Milestone #1**.  
Future milestones will include ideation, prototyping, implementation, and evaluation of the indoor navigation system.
