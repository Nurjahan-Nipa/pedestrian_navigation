Problem Statement: 1 page

People (Students, staff, and visitors) who need to find classrooms, offices, labs, restrooms, or events inside Patrick F. Taylor Hall (PFT) often experience confusion 
and delays during indoor navigation, even when they try to rely on room numbers, signage, maps, or their phones. Common breakdowns happen around unclear room-numbering 
patterns, insufficient or hard-to-interpret directional signage, similar-looking hallways that reduce orientation, and difficult floor transitions (stairs/elevators). 
These problems can be very annoying when people are short on time or trying to find easy ways to get around, like lifts, ramps and automatic doors. So, a lot of people 
use ad-hoc coping strategies like asking others for help, which might not be reliable or easy. This formative study investigates these real navigation pain points, the 
cues people actually use, and barriers to adoption in order to derive user needs and design requirements for a usable digital indoor navigation system for PFT.


Formative Study (About 2 pages): 

Semi-structured

10–20 minutes long

Around 8–12 questions

🔹 Ideal number: 10 questions
That’s enough to get depth, but not overwhelm participants.

🎤 Interview Guide (Semi-Structured)

Title: Indoor Navigation Experience Interview
Duration: 15 minutes
Participants: Students / Staff / Visitors

🔹 Section 1: Background (2–3 questions)

What is your role on campus? (Student, staff, visitor, etc.)

How familiar are you with this campus/building?

How often do you visit large or complex buildings (e.g., hospitals, malls, university buildings)?

🔹 Section 2: Experience & Problems (Core Section)

Can you describe a time when you had difficulty finding a room or office inside a building?

👉 (Follow-up probes)

What happened?

How did you feel?

How much time did you lose?

When you cannot find a location indoors, what do you usually do?

What makes indoor navigation difficult for you?

👉 (Probe examples)

Room numbering?

Poor signage?

No maps?

Stress before class?

Have you ever been late because you couldn’t find a location?
What was that experience like?

🔹 Section 3: Accessibility & Needs

Do you have any preferences when navigating buildings?
(e.g., elevator vs stairs, shortest path vs easiest path)

Have you ever struggled to find an accessible route (e.g., elevator, ramp)?

🔹 Section 4: Future Solutions

If a campus indoor navigation system existed, what features would you expect or want?

👉 Probes:

Turn-by-turn directions?

Voice guidance?

Real-time location?

Emergency exits?
