00:00:04.228 --> 00:00:11.228
Okay. To a stand. So, what is your role on campus? Are you a student, staff, or visitor?

00:00:10.332 --> 00:00:16.332
I'm a graduate student… I'm a PhD student. I'm also graduate assistant.

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.029
Okay, thank you. How familiar are you with PFT?

00:00:23.385 --> 00:00:50.385
Um, um… Well, I know the entrances, and some glasses that I have already taken, some rooms, and the… Um, I… I mostly know… Fast floor not not all the rooms in first floor, but I can navigate through first floor and second floor, like, um…

00:00:55.142 --> 00:00:57.142
Uh, more than enough, I think.

00:00:57.142 --> 00:00:59.167
Okay. What types of places do you usually look for in PFT?

00:01:04.118 --> 00:01:07.118
Look for in PFT.

00:01:07.118 --> 00:01:08.815
What type of place do you generally? Go.

00:01:07.148 --> 00:01:18.148
Like, uh, like, okay, I… I go to my lab, and Panera, and washroom, and also, uh… also on third floor.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:28.620
Um… Um, on on third floor, I mostly go to lactation room, because we have to say prayer.

00:01:28.595 --> 00:01:43.595
And… Sometimes I have to, uh, go to teachers' rooms for meeting purpose, um… Yeah, and also the classes I'm taking those classes.

00:01:43.595 --> 00:01:44.004
Okay.

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.939
Those classrooms, actually.

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:52.605
Okay. So how would you describe navigating inside PFT?

00:01:56.502 --> 00:02:00.502
What makes it easy or difficult?

00:02:00.503 --> 00:02:17.284
Okay, so for navigation, I mostly use the signboards on the ceiling, like… Uh, it says room this to that is this direction, but it takes some time to find everything, because… I would say it is that confusing, but…

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:22.559
Like, I always follow those signs that's written there.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.824
Mm-hmm.

00:02:23.262 --> 00:02:33.262
Yeah. Can you describe a time or event when you had trouble finding a room or office inside the 50?

00:02:34.582 --> 00:03:07.582
Oh… So I would say I mostly use those signs that's written on the wall. And I don't have that much trouble, to be honest, if I follow… But the thing is that I can't take shortcut, like, if I, uh, if I… if I want to go someplace quickly, but there's a shortcut, but I don't know that place, but I have to follow the sign, it takes a long…

00:03:14.984 --> 00:03:16.984
Yeah.

00:03:16.985 --> 00:03:21.818
route to go to that place. And sometimes I have to find those signs, because those signs are not everywhere, so I have to go to the signs, and then follow back all the way.

00:03:21.818 --> 00:03:22.458
Mm-hmm.

00:03:22.352 --> 00:03:31.352
Yeah, so where did you… you get stuck sometimes, or it was okay to follow?

00:03:31.195 --> 00:03:41.195
Yeah, like, sometimes the… Sometimes I… when I don't understand the science.

00:03:41.195 --> 00:03:46.960
Mm-hmm.

00:03:46.961 --> 00:03:54.463
Or when I don't notice the signs, I… I mean, sometimes I'm in a rush. I think that I know the place, but I went to a totally different area, and I don't know where I have come.

00:03:54.625 --> 00:03:59.625
I mean, I… I can memorize the corridors all the time.

00:03:59.649 --> 00:04:08.649
So, then again, I have to follow all the signs, and then go to the address. So it takes a long time there.

00:04:08.649 --> 00:04:12.853
Mm-hmm. Yeah. How did you feel at that moment?

00:04:13.207 --> 00:04:17.207
I feel frustrated, like, honestly, like, I feel… I feel lost.

00:04:21.266 --> 00:04:23.266
He's lost.

00:04:23.266 --> 00:04:26.097
Yeah, exactly. For finding such place that you don't know how much extra time do you need, approximately?

00:04:26.322 --> 00:04:33.322
Uh… like… 5 minutes, I would say.

00:04:33.142 --> 00:04:41.142
Okay. So when you cannot find a location inside PFT, what you usually do?

00:04:47.265 --> 00:04:49.265
Hmm.

00:04:53.402 --> 00:04:55.402
Mm-hmm.

00:04:55.402 --> 00:04:56.673
Yeah, I look for the signs. So, oh, firstly, I have to have numbers that, like, room numbers or something. But then again, there are some numbers, some rooms.

00:04:58.134 --> 00:05:02.134
Mm-hmm. Hmm.

00:05:02.135 --> 00:05:04.241
Which doesn't have numbers, and… Then, then it becomes very confusing.

00:05:04.242 --> 00:05:09.772
Mm-hmm.

00:05:09.772 --> 00:05:18.034
And also, some rooms are in a very odd position, like, the numbers are not matching, like, it's not in a regular basis, so… Um, and there's no sign for that.

00:05:18.034 --> 00:05:20.397
Mm-hmm.

00:05:20.398 --> 00:05:25.989
Um, that always becomes very difficult.

00:05:25.989 --> 00:05:29.267
At that time, do you ask someone for help, or… Any maps?

00:05:29.267 --> 00:05:36.720
Yeah, yeah. I ask for help, but not all the time. Most of the time, people say that I don't know also, like… They are just like me.

00:05:35.667 --> 00:05:42.667
Yeah. Do you use your phone at that time for searching the room?

00:05:43.923 --> 00:05:49.923
It doesn't help. Because there's no map inside my phone for that.

00:05:49.924 --> 00:05:50.830
Mm-hmm. Uh, then, yeah.

00:05:51.158 --> 00:05:58.158
So hot parts of PFT feel most confusing or slow to navigate to you?

00:06:04.299 --> 00:06:07.299
Uh, okay, um…

00:06:07.299 --> 00:06:07.593
I… any room numbering, signage, or hollows look similar?

00:06:13.313 --> 00:06:14.313
Anything?

00:06:14.313 --> 00:06:28.454
There's there's some room, some corridors, like… Um, if I talk like, um… Okay, the oasis we had before, it was room number 1, 1246, or something.

00:06:28.454 --> 00:06:33.343
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

00:06:33.315 --> 00:06:59.920
You remember the OS class we had. So that corridor. I sometimes don't find that and also another one, one, two, five, three, the rooms in 1st floor, and… And uh… I don't know if it's in second place, there are… I have… I don't have problems taken. Oh, I have trouble to find, like, the, uh, like, Ali's office all the time. Um, so…

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:10.640
Um, all that I used to have at the beginning. Like, when, uh, we went to computers office, like, CSC office.

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:17.450
Uh, and then I remembered it is somewhere there, but I couldn't… I forgot where the door was.

00:07:18.102 --> 00:07:29.102
And also, Craig's office, and all… and… Um, finding an ID guy thinks these rooms, actually.

00:07:29.101 --> 00:07:38.013
Mm-hmm. So what not confusing or missing thing to find that room?

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:43.410
Oh. Yeah, definitely, I would say a map.

00:07:47.413 --> 00:07:49.413
Mm-hmm.

00:07:49.414 --> 00:07:58.159
Because if I had a map, it would have been easier, like, real-time map, the place where I am, and where I want to go. If I could search the place on the map, and… Uh, could immediately find…

00:08:02.523 --> 00:08:04.523
Then it could have been good.

00:08:04.524 --> 00:08:11.942
Yeah. Okay. So how about flow transitions? Sometimes. Yeah, stairs or elevators. Is it easy to find? Did it help?

00:08:11.942 --> 00:08:23.041
Yeah, elevators are hard to find sometimes. Like, I know two or by this time, I know, but I… by this time, I know two or three elevators, because I had been.

00:08:22.981 --> 00:08:27.981
Over one year now. But at the beginning.

00:08:28.166 --> 00:08:42.166
I used to… I'm finding elevator was very hard, and I didn't know which elevator… I mean, I needed to find shortcut ways, so it was hard to find.

00:08:42.167 --> 00:08:42.222
Okay. Mm-hmm.

00:08:43.192 --> 00:08:49.192
Like, I had class, I have to rush to it, but I'm taking a very long route for that.

00:08:50.189 --> 00:09:05.189
I can go that quickly, and there… I don't… I forgot where daily water is. I don't know if there is a elevator just by my… Um, just by my classroom, but I'm taking the staircase, which is very far from that.

00:09:06.141 --> 00:09:11.141
Um, yeah, things used to be like that. Uh, at the beginning.

00:09:11.441 --> 00:09:28.441
Yeah. So, you already said that whenever navigating inside a building, you use the signage. So, what this sign is, other than that sign is, what helps you most?

00:09:33.864 --> 00:09:36.864
On navigating inside a building.

00:09:36.865 --> 00:09:43.932
Uh, I don't have any other things right now, because it's only… I only got more… more familiar with the… with this place.

00:09:49.153 --> 00:09:51.153
Mm-hmm.

00:09:51.153 --> 00:09:56.758
That's what helps, like, um, as I'm always going, so I kind of remember some places, but other than the signs, there's nothing else, actually.

00:09:56.759 --> 00:09:59.087
Mm-hmm.

00:09:59.087 --> 00:10:01.690
Yeah. So Robert.

00:10:01.691 --> 00:10:08.586
And it is very confusing, like, if… I mean, if we didn't have these signs, it would have been… worse.

00:10:12.409 --> 00:10:15.409
It would have been a worst experience.

00:10:15.409 --> 00:10:27.968
Yeah. So, do you have any preference on navigating billing? For example, elevator versus stairs, shortest path versus easiest path, then avoiding crowded areas, carrying heavy objects.

00:10:27.808 --> 00:10:39.808
So… I use… I mostly use elevators, but I mostly use elevators, but not all of the… all the time it is free.

00:10:27.968 --> 00:10:28.778
Yeah, I'm…

00:10:39.538 --> 00:10:57.538
And then I take the staircase. So it also took some time for me to find the staircase also. Like, I am waiting for the elevators for a long time, but I don't know, there is a stair just right beside me and I could take that.

00:10:58.195 --> 00:11:10.195
Uh, after some… after a long time, I… I… I got to know that there is a… there was a staircase, and then… I mean, like… Finding this out took a long time for me.

00:11:10.677 --> 00:11:21.677
Yeah. So, do you have that preference that when carrying heavy objects or lightweight objects, or you are hard somehow.

00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:29.470
Uh, you wanna avoid crowded areas.

00:11:29.471 --> 00:11:31.323
Yeah, yeah, for when I'm carrying heavy objects, I take elevators, always.

00:11:31.499 --> 00:11:44.499
So, have you ever struggled to find an accessible route inside PFT, like elevator, ram, emergency exit, or automatic doors?

00:11:47.394 --> 00:11:57.394
Have you ever struggle to find accessible route? Like, yeah, when you are, like, 11th hour ramp.

00:11:57.394 --> 00:12:05.182
Have Wi-Fi… can you repeat the question? Oh. Yeah, like, sometimes… yeah, so… So, yeah, I sometimes forget where the staircases are or where the elevators are. Um, I sometimes forget that.

00:12:09.027 --> 00:12:11.027
Yeah.

00:12:11.027 --> 00:12:15.997
So there's no sign for the elevator. Like, yeah, there are signs for stairs, but not for the elevators. So I struggled for the elevators.

00:12:20.037 --> 00:12:22.037
Find out the elevators.

00:12:22.038 --> 00:12:26.198
Okay, as a pet is trying, do you use any digital navigation system outdoors, like Google Maps or Apple Maps?

00:12:27.785 --> 00:12:35.785
Uh, for outdoor, I always use Google Map. For outdoor, like… Roots?

00:12:35.785 --> 00:12:40.177
Okay. Mm-hmm. What do you like about that system?

00:12:40.177 --> 00:12:45.670
Yeah, yeah, I always use Google. So, it always… it's always easy to find a place, like, I can search.

00:12:46.054 --> 00:12:53.054
Uh, a place, and your daughter shows up, and it shows me the, uh, shortest route.

00:12:53.095 --> 00:13:01.095
So, um, it takes me a lot less time, minimum amount of time to go to a place.

00:13:01.096 --> 00:13:11.277
And it shows me where I am and where the place I want to go is. It, uh… It's very easy, and convenient.

00:13:16.926 --> 00:13:21.926
Yeah, what other features you like? So…

00:13:21.926 --> 00:13:25.779
So, um… so the map is very good like I can understand where the roads are.

00:13:29.411 --> 00:13:31.411
Mm-hmm.

00:13:31.411 --> 00:13:40.155
the description and the pictures, images. Um… Uh… And all of the names, the name of the place, that those are clear.

00:13:40.155 --> 00:13:46.118
Mm-hmm.

00:13:46.119 --> 00:13:53.745
And also, sometimes it shows where that traffic is, like, real time, like, if there's a lot of traffic on road, it shows with like YoloRight. Then I can plan my route.

00:13:57.993 --> 00:13:59.993
Yeah.

00:13:59.993 --> 00:14:03.745
If I want to avoid traffic, or if I want… I can… I can schedule some time later, I can do that with Google Map.

00:14:03.894 --> 00:14:13.894
Right. So would you use a digital indoor navigation system for 50 Hawaii or Hawaii North?

00:14:13.593 --> 00:14:29.593
Uh, yeah, definitely, because it will help me. Uh, I would say if I had been a new… new student here, that would definitely help me, but still, I… I'm an old, like, one year old, but still I would use that.

00:14:29.995 --> 00:14:44.995
Because there are still some places which are new to me, and also some places which I have forgotten about the route, and I don't want to follow the sign, honestly, like, because it takes a long time to find a place by following the signs.

00:14:44.796 --> 00:14:55.796
So I want to find the shortest, shortest route to go to a place, and for that, I definitely want to use the navigation… digital navigation… navigation system.

00:14:55.828 --> 00:15:06.828
Okay, so if we design such a system, what might stop you from using that digital indoor navigational system?

00:15:09.157 --> 00:15:24.157
Uh… if the real-time… Well, if I have trouble with searching a place, like, if, uh, like, I'm searching it with a number, room number, and it doesn't appear.

00:15:25.273 --> 00:15:41.273
Uh, and also… Uh… like… Um, also, there are some places it doesn't have room number, but it has name. So, if the name doesn't appear, like, if the map doesn't have all the names and places.

00:15:41.649 --> 00:15:46.649
And I will not use that name, because it's not helping me.

00:15:46.650 --> 00:15:47.189
Mm-hmm.

00:15:47.189 --> 00:15:52.344
Alright.

00:15:52.345 --> 00:15:55.118
And also, I want to have the location of the elevators and stair stairs.

00:15:55.118 --> 00:15:59.746
Hmm.

00:15:59.746 --> 00:16:10.812
And all the rooms, and also the name of the room. Some lab have names, so not all the time we have numbers, room numbers, but we have names for the lab.

00:16:10.709 --> 00:16:19.709
Um, so… It is, uh, I would love if the map have updated name.

00:16:26.394 --> 00:16:27.394
Mm-hmm.

00:16:27.395 --> 00:16:33.578
of the labs. Um, like, their MMR lab, the construction department. So I don't… I know it by the name more than by the room number.

00:16:38.191 --> 00:16:43.191
Oh, that would be very useful for me.

00:16:43.191 --> 00:16:49.169
Okay, that's good. Mm-hmm. Those are all the questions, so… is there anything else you would like to share about navigating inside PFT? Anything we didn't cover?

00:16:49.536 --> 00:17:03.536
Uh, I don't know if it's possible, but if there could be a system where we could know how much traffic is, how much busy and elevator is, that would have been very good, like.

00:17:06.823 --> 00:17:08.823
Okay.

00:17:08.823 --> 00:17:13.974
Mm-hmm.

00:17:13.975 --> 00:17:15.823
Um, sometimes the elevator takes a long time to come, but then if we could know how many people are inside the elevators, um, that would have been very good.

00:17:19.696 --> 00:17:22.696
Okay, thank you.

00:17:22.696 --> 00:17:27.202
And also Panera time, because, um, sometimes banners of… especially in summertime.

00:17:28.128 --> 00:17:36.128
And it remains closed. So if I could see from map that banner is open or not, then it would have been very good.

00:17:35.535 --> 00:17:45.535
Alright. Okay, thank you so much for your time. It was nice talking to you, and we got… Very important.
