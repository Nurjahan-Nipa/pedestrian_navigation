00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:12.490
Hi, thank you for joining today. I'm going to ask you a few questions about your experience navigating inside PFD.

00:00:12.707 --> 00:00:20.707
And, uh, this is not a test for you. We are studying the, uh, building navigation experience, so this interview will take approximately 10 minutes.

00:00:20.894 --> 00:00:25.894
And your responsive will be… responses will be used for our research and design purposes only.

00:00:26.371 --> 00:00:32.371
You can skip any question or stop at any time. So, do you have any permission to proceed?

00:00:32.651 --> 00:00:34.651
Yep. Okay, let's start.

00:00:35.615 --> 00:00:40.615
Okay. We are going to record this session, the audio recording only.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:52.560
Okay, okay. To start, what is your role on campus? Are you a student, or…? So, yeah, I'm a student, I'm a graduate student, and I just work in my

00:00:53.034 --> 00:00:56.034
I left slash office, and…

00:00:57.071 --> 00:01:01.071
They mostly go around PFT for meetings, and…

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.640
stuff, yeah, that's it. Okay. Now, how familiar are you with PFD?

00:01:06.421 --> 00:01:08.421
Um… I kinda am.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.340
But…

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.401
So, it's like, the places I have been to,

00:01:13.997 --> 00:01:16.997
I know. Uh, it's like, uh…

00:01:17.985 --> 00:01:23.985
So, if I have to go to a specific office that I've already been to, I can, but if I'm going to a new place, it's…

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:29.939
kind of difficult to navigate. Yeah. Like, are you regularly… is it PFT, or…?

00:01:29.975 --> 00:01:36.975
Is it sometimes or often in a week? Oh, I… I'd like to say a regular day, a regular visit. Visit me.

00:01:38.472 --> 00:01:43.472
And as you already mentioned, that you visit your labs, office, and uh…

00:01:43.876 --> 00:01:48.876
and other places, like, can you mention the specific places, other places?

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:57.389
Okay, so in PFD, I go to get coffee from the cafe. That is one of my usual routes.

00:01:57.905 --> 00:02:01.905
Yeah. I come to my lab, which is on the second floor, the coffee place is on the first floor,

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:06.980
Uh, I go to my, uh…

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.820
advise us for meetings, that is on the third floor.

00:02:12.471 --> 00:02:21.471
And maybe some other places, uh, like, now I'm doing a TA, and I have to go to meet that specific professor in another…

00:02:22.446 --> 00:02:26.446
office. Basically, that's it. And…

00:02:27.526 --> 00:02:35.526
If I know and have to meet a specific person or a friend inside BFD, we just coordinate and meet at a specific place.

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.530
What about the restrooms and other places you visited them?

00:02:40.347 --> 00:02:43.347
Oh, I shouldn't say restaurants included? Yeah. Yeah, of course. Okay.

00:02:43.528 --> 00:02:53.528
Uh, as you have already mentioned, that if there is a familiar place, you would know that place, and you can navigate that place easily, but if there is an unknown place,

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:01.230
It's a bit difficult. It is a bit difficult, yeah. It takes time. I have to go… I have to watch through

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:13.180
all the navigation boards they have up there, which is quite confusing, I'm not gonna lie, and I have to figure out where this specific room is, and go there.

00:03:13.181 --> 00:03:15.083
Mm-hmm.

00:03:15.988 --> 00:03:24.988
And, uh, can you describe a specific event when you, uh, travel, when you face travel to find a room or office inside PFD? Okay, so…

00:03:26.161 --> 00:03:29.161
I remember I had this meeting with, uh…

00:03:29.728 --> 00:03:32.728
new, uh, instructor…

00:03:33.147 --> 00:03:40.147
for a subject that I was studying for, and it was our first meeting, and I had to go visit him in person in his office,

00:03:40.147 --> 00:03:42.458
Yeah. Which is also in the third floor.

00:03:42.455 --> 00:03:44.455
But I'm not used to…

00:03:44.886 --> 00:03:46.886
those early are BFDs. Mm-hmm.

00:03:46.901 --> 00:03:48.901
Right? Uh…

00:03:49.044 --> 00:03:55.044
So, what I did was, I looked in… like, I remembered the…

00:03:55.033 --> 00:04:01.033
number of the office, like, the room is, like, like, PFD something something something.

00:04:02.011 --> 00:04:12.011
And I went there, I went to the third floor, I looked literally navigated my way through the signboards they had placed in… on top of, like,

00:04:12.854 --> 00:04:14.854
in different intersections and stuff.

00:04:15.547 --> 00:04:23.547
And I roamed around, did take a few wrong turns, but ultimately, I ended up

00:04:24.174 --> 00:04:32.174
finding the room. But later, I realized there is a better and softer way that I could have taken, but…

00:04:34.315 --> 00:04:39.315
But it kind of happens only after I found… after I find a specific place.

00:04:39.315 --> 00:04:48.458
Yeah. And other than, like, when I'm finding the place, because when I'm finding the place, I'm looking through that navigation they have in the PFV buildings.

00:04:48.565 --> 00:04:50.565
And that, actually,

00:04:51.231 --> 00:05:01.231
gives you, uh, like, that actually guides you, right? It helps, but it does not help to find the room exactly, or specifically…

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:11.160
in, like, quick time. Like, it doesn't serve the purpose of finding a room quickly, or, like, easily finding the easiest path. It just helps you to…

00:05:12.947 --> 00:05:17.947
make decisions so you can turn. Yeah, you can make a turn. That's it.

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.760
And, uh, how did you feel at that moment?

00:05:21.931 --> 00:05:25.931
So, I was running late, right? And, uh,

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:28.900
I was running late, but…

00:05:30.071 --> 00:05:35.071
And a little bit… no, I was not stressed, per se, but you can say I was a little bit…

00:05:36.023 --> 00:05:38.023
No, I want to find a better word.

00:05:38.986 --> 00:05:40.986
For…

00:05:41.168 --> 00:05:43.168
Stress, I was not panicking.

00:05:45.484 --> 00:05:50.484
Let's say I was stretched. Okay. I was pretending I was stretched. But, okay. Yeah, because I was running late, I just…

00:05:50.502 --> 00:05:52.502
found the room, like, 5 minutes…

00:05:53.168 --> 00:05:56.168
After our allocated meeting time. Mm-hmm.

00:05:56.168 --> 00:06:05.078
And then I just went there, and I was like, ah, sorry, PFD, right? And he was like, uh, PFD, right? Okay. Yeah.

00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:21.969
When you cannot find a location, like this, like this event, what do you use usually do? Do you only read the signboard, or do you have any other way to find that? Usually, I read the signboards, and that helps. It might not take you through the easiest way, but it will…

00:06:22.013 --> 00:06:24.013
take you to the destination, right?

00:06:24.128 --> 00:06:28.128
If that doesn't work, I just ask people.

00:06:28.128 --> 00:06:30.962
But that happens quite rarely. Yeah.

00:06:31.203 --> 00:06:33.203
Because the sand boards, their help.

00:06:33.824 --> 00:06:43.824
Um… mostly died. And occasionally, to remember some places, I just go through PFTs, uh, this map,

00:06:44.399 --> 00:06:47.399
Megs and maps they have.

00:06:47.703 --> 00:06:50.703
And… yeah, pretty much it.

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:56.840
Also, I do remember the directions, by the way, so it's like…

00:06:57.084 --> 00:07:08.084
east, west, north, and south. So if somebody asks me to meet somewhere, I'm like, which part of the PFD is it in? Is it, like, east, west, south, north? And then I just…

00:07:08.233 --> 00:07:12.233
go to that space place, and then navigate through the sandbox. Yeah.

00:07:12.234 --> 00:07:20.803
That is a good idea. Do you ever try using your phone inside PFT, like, for navigating? For navigating, that doesn't work, does it?

00:07:21.932 --> 00:07:27.932
No, I don't… I don't know. Never. I don't know, if they were… if they were, uh…

00:07:28.532 --> 00:07:36.532
map for a specific building, like PFT, I might, but I don't know if there is something like that, a system like that.

00:07:37.008 --> 00:07:40.008
Okay. So I don't know how I use the phone to navigate.

00:07:39.987 --> 00:07:46.987
Okay. Uh, and what parts of PFT feel most confusing, or, uh, difficult to navigate for you?

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:53.840
Maybe a long hallway with many rooms, maybe?

00:07:54.084 --> 00:08:03.084
Uh, when… whenever… I get confused whenever I change floors, so I know a floor whenever I'm walking, and when I'm, like, I change… I go to the next floor,

00:08:03.443 --> 00:08:05.443
It's like, um, a different layout. Mm-hmm.

00:08:06.115 --> 00:08:11.115
And most of that. Mostly, where I have not visited. It's like, some places I have not been.

00:08:11.512 --> 00:08:14.512
Or it's, like, new to me, I get confused. Otherwise…

00:08:15.242 --> 00:08:23.242
Just, like, pretty easy. You get confused because the floors are different, uh, organized, or the room numbers are different.

00:08:24.233 --> 00:08:34.233
What specifically make you confused? It's like the floors layout. Okay. If it was the same layout as the second floor, right, I would only have to remember one floor, and I'll go, okay, so this…

00:08:34.528 --> 00:08:41.528
The restrooms are there, and the offices are there, but it's, like, completely different between the floors, so it's kind of difficult.

00:08:41.912 --> 00:08:51.912
Okay. What about the sign boards? How do you find the signboards attached in the PFT? Do you find them very convenient, or do you find them confusing sometimes?

00:08:53.699 --> 00:08:58.699
It gets you to where you want to go, but it's confusing to…

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:04.280
uh, like, decipher it at that moment. But it takes a little bit of time.

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:09.184
And you get a hang of it when you get… you get to using it.

00:09:09.196 --> 00:09:11.196
And…

00:09:11.675 --> 00:09:14.675
Yeah, and then it takes you to a specific place.

00:09:16.208 --> 00:09:28.208
It's not that bad. Yeah. I'll go back to the previous question, like, you say that the hallways look, uh, hallways are confusing. Is it because they look similar, similar, or…?

00:09:28.209 --> 00:09:33.244
they look very different. Why is it confusing to you? It might be the…

00:09:33.882 --> 00:09:35.882
It might be because it's… hmm.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.120
hallways, I feel like…

00:09:41.663 --> 00:09:45.663
they are pretty much empty. Mm-hmm.

00:09:48.152 --> 00:09:53.152
And… maybe, because it's similar. So, since this is empty…

00:09:54.689 --> 00:09:59.689
is similar to the last one I just saw, and it would be like, oh, I just walked this path, and maybe not, oh…

00:10:00.432 --> 00:10:08.432
Yeah, maybe because I was simulated. Yeah, what about the flow transitions, like the stairs and elevators, do they help you to navigate

00:10:08.981 --> 00:10:14.981
In some way. You know, so I do have this mental map that I have created, right? So, if one stares,

00:10:15.061 --> 00:10:17.061
So, it's like…

00:10:18.019 --> 00:10:27.019
A stiff from the second floor leads to the third floor, then I know exactly where I am, right? Because the stairs becomes your focal point. Yeah. Between… to connect between the floors.

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:29.040
Same with the elevators. Mm-hmm.

00:10:29.348 --> 00:10:36.348
So, if… also, this also… so this is also something I do. So, if I ever get lost in some places, I just go back to the elevator.

00:10:37.081 --> 00:10:43.081
Yeah. Because it's the focal point, and I know how things are organized around the elevators.

00:10:43.681 --> 00:10:47.681
And, uh, what cues help you the most when navigating inside a building?

00:10:52.059 --> 00:10:59.059
I'm not sure what cues help me. You mentioned about your mental model, but is there any specific, like, the elevator

00:10:59.906 --> 00:11:02.906
Could be one thing. The inhibitor is one thing. Yeah, is there anything else?

00:11:03.763 --> 00:11:05.763
Um…

00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:08.020
landmarks, maybe? Mm-hmm.

00:11:08.512 --> 00:11:13.512
Right, so landmarks might help. So, if I know, like, the Panera is there, right, I can…

00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:19.710
I know what is around Panera, or if I know the capstone is there, I would…

00:11:20.667 --> 00:11:25.667
basically can… I can basically paint a faint picture in my brain, so these things are wrong.

00:11:25.781 --> 00:11:27.781
Okay.

00:11:30.945 --> 00:11:35.945
If you have to choose, do you really relay more on signage or landmarks? What would you say?

00:11:40.234 --> 00:11:42.234
Both. Okay.

00:11:42.235 --> 00:11:45.748
But if there are no signs, I'll…

00:11:46.018 --> 00:11:48.018
rely on landmarks.

00:11:48.558 --> 00:11:53.558
Yeah. Right? Yeah. But if I'm following the same, uh, I rely on…

00:11:53.945 --> 00:11:58.945
Signs. But, uh, understand the question a little bit more away.

00:12:01.475 --> 00:12:03.475
So if there is…

00:12:03.499 --> 00:12:05.499
So, it's like…

00:12:05.876 --> 00:12:19.876
intuitively, I follow the landmarks, right? Because I would not remember, okay, so this room is 3,024… this room is, like, 3245. I'll not do that. I'll be like, oh, this room is in this hallway, which is beside Panera.

00:12:20.735 --> 00:12:25.735
So, it's, like, intuitively, it's landmark, but if you have to find a specific room,

00:12:26.561 --> 00:12:30.561
Or a new, new place. New place? The sign is actually. Okay.

00:12:30.595 --> 00:12:32.595
Okay. It makes sense.

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:35.940
Do you have any preference when navigating buildings? Like…

00:12:36.583 --> 00:12:44.583
You have already mentioned that you wanted to find easy path for that. So, is there anything else you want to add with that?

00:12:45.405 --> 00:12:52.405
So, I want to, uh, I want to find an easy path, maybe if I have to, I need… I want to avoid some places.

00:12:53.131 --> 00:12:59.131
Right, so if I don't want to go through this hallway, then I should be able to avoid that and find a different route.

00:12:59.437 --> 00:13:02.437
Uh… maybe add stops?

00:13:02.646 --> 00:13:10.646
Alright, so if I want to go to, like, third floor from the first floor, I would, like, make a stop in the cafe, and then go to the restroom, and then go to…

00:13:11.269 --> 00:13:16.269
a specific place, and find out, like, a good route for the pro… throughout the flow.

00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:19.015
Yeah. Um…

00:13:20.117 --> 00:13:23.117
I would also like to know where the roof access is, but I'm kidding.

00:13:24.273 --> 00:13:30.273
Uh, but that would be helpful, though. Okay. Have you ever struggled to find an accessible route inside PFT, like…

00:13:30.274 --> 00:13:35.985
Elevator or ramp, or automatic doors, like, you are injured, and you want to use the accessible roads.

00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:37.980
Um, not really.

00:13:38.781 --> 00:13:43.781
not really, but there might be a few, but I have not experienced that. Okay.

00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:49.020
Okay. As a beta-starion, do you use any digital navigation system outdoors?

00:13:49.647 --> 00:13:58.647
Yeah, I do use Google Maps and stuff. Google Maps, I use AllTrails, I use, uh, Apple Maps, different kinds of languages. Okay.

00:13:58.903 --> 00:14:02.903
What do you like most about these systems?

00:14:03.556 --> 00:14:05.556
Uh…

00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:11.750
If you are a pedestrian using this… Oh, if I'm a pedestrian, right? Yeah.

00:14:13.353 --> 00:14:21.353
It gives me the hardest way. I don't want to walk, like, 40 minutes to reach a place, right? Yeah. If there's, like, a 20-minute path, it just shows me the 20-minute path.

00:14:21.587 --> 00:14:27.587
Also, I have the preference of choosing the path as well, so if someday I just don't want to go through that,

00:14:28.167 --> 00:14:32.167
Uh, yeah, because there's, like, lots of traffic. I can just take a different path. Yeah.

00:14:32.167 --> 00:14:34.158
There is the path option as well.

00:14:34.878 --> 00:14:38.878
Uh, it also tells us, like, where I am in the map. That is really helpful.

00:14:38.895 --> 00:14:40.895
Yeah. I feel like that is…

00:14:41.543 --> 00:14:50.543
the key issue that is missing from, like, this PFT navigation, that you know, okay, so you know where to turn, but you don't know exactly where you are.

00:14:51.467 --> 00:14:53.467
Hmm, what else? Uh…

00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:57.958
And that's pretty much it. Okay.

00:14:58.881 --> 00:15:01.881
Uh, do you ever use a digital indoor navigation system for PFT?

00:15:02.669 --> 00:15:09.669
You know what, I might. Specifically, if I am in a rush to get somewhere, and I cannot find a place,

00:15:09.896 --> 00:15:11.896
I would.

00:15:12.364 --> 00:15:16.364
Because it's convenient, it's already in my phone, right? Yeah. Just pull it out and look through it.

00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:20.780
Yeah, and what do you think, uh, could be…

00:15:21.482 --> 00:15:25.482
Could be a moment, uh, that would stop you from using this kind of navigation.

00:15:25.916 --> 00:15:29.916
diesel navigation system. Mmm…

00:15:33.130 --> 00:15:42.130
Maybe if it's more of a hassle to go through the app to find out the, like, the places, to find out

00:15:42.866 --> 00:15:48.866
to navigate yourself, let's say, than to use, like, physical science and stuff, I would, like,

00:15:48.917 --> 00:15:51.917
go back to the physical sciences rather than the phones.

00:15:52.875 --> 00:15:57.875
Uh, otherwise, I might stick to the… to… by phone, because it's, like, handy.

00:15:57.775 --> 00:16:03.775
And specifically, if it tells me where I am in the map, right, it helps a lot.

00:16:04.362 --> 00:16:12.362
Okay. Okay, those were all my questions. Is there anything else you'd like to share about Navigating Inside PFT?

00:16:13.948 --> 00:16:17.948
No, I think that's it. Okay, thank you so much for your time. Thank you. Thank you for participating.
