So, this is an interview for our Human-Computer Interaction class.

22:08:58
We are discussing the indoor navigation experience in the Patrick F. Taylor (PFT) engineering building.

22:09:12
I’m going to ask you some questions. It may take around 15–20 minutes. Is that okay?

22:09:20
Yeah, that’s okay for me.

22:09:25
For privacy reasons, we will only record the transcript of this interview, and your name will not be included.

22:09:41
Okay, that would be great.

22:09:44
So first, let me ask about your background. What’s your role on campus? Are you a student or are you working on campus?

22:09:53
I’m a student, and I have a graduate assistantship.

22:10:01
How familiar are you with the PFT building?

22:10:04
I’ve had two classes there, so I’m kind of familiar with it.

22:10:11
How long have you been going there, and how often do you go to PFT?

22:10:19
It has been two semesters, and I go there regularly for classes.

22:10:29
When you are in PFT, what type of rooms are you usually looking for?

22:10:37
I mostly go to classrooms and attend labs. Sometimes I look for professors’ offices, and occasionally I go to Panera.

22:10:52
So mostly classrooms, and sometimes Panera or professors’ offices?

22:10:57
Yes.

22:11:14
How would you describe the process of navigating inside PFT? Is it easy or hard?

22:11:29
I think it’s relatively easy. But once, when I tried to find one of the auditoriums, it took me some time.

22:11:42
Can you tell me more about what happened?

22:12:17
I entered from a side door near the Business building, close to Panera. I followed the overhead signs that told me to go straight. But when I got there, I saw another sign and got confused.

22:13:09
The room numbers didn’t match what I expected. I turned around, and finally realized the auditorium was actually in a corner. It was close, but I had missed a left turn before reaching it.

22:13:53
How long did it take compared to if you had known where it was?

22:14:19
If I knew the room, it would take less than one minute. But it probably took about five minutes to find it the first time.

22:14:42
What did you do when you had trouble finding the room? Did you ask someone or just look at signs?

22:14:54
I’m kind of shy, so I didn’t ask anyone. I looked at the signs again and checked the room number ranges. When I noticed the numbers were going in the wrong direction, I went back and tried again until I found it.

22:15:25
What do you think is most confusing in PFT? Room numbers, signs, hallways, or floor transitions?

22:16:00
Panera is easy to find because it has a very big sign. But some room numbers are small, and you need to check door by door. The overhead hallway signs are easy to see.

22:16:47
So once you are near the area, it’s more about noticing the specific room?

22:16:50
Yes. I just missed it because I turned left too early. If I had gone straight a little more, the room was there.

22:17:14
What helps you the most when you are looking for a room in PFT?

22:17:49
I usually remember the first route I took and repeat it every time. I don’t really rely on landmarks except for major ones like Panera.

22:18:09
Do you prefer stairs or elevators?

22:18:22
Mostly stairs. If my class is upstairs, I take the stairs.

22:19:26
If your usual route is blocked, what would you do?

22:19:46
I would follow the signs and adjust. If I need to turn left, I turn left; if right, I turn right. I’ll find another way.

22:20:07
After several visits, do you feel familiar enough to always find your way?

22:20:10
Yes, after going several times, you know where to go.

22:20:43
When navigating outdoors as a pedestrian, do you use any digital navigation system like Google Maps?

22:20:53
I live very close to PFT. It takes me about six minutes to walk there, so I don’t need navigation.

22:21:15
How do you remember the path?

22:21:30
I just go the same route every time. There aren’t many choices. I cross the road and keep going straight.

22:22:02
How about navigating between buildings on campus?

22:22:09
If I can’t remember, I use Google Maps.

22:22:16
What do you like or dislike about Google Maps?

22:22:40
It generally gives good directions. Sometimes it may not give the absolute shortest path, but you can still reach your destination.

22:23:12
We are trying to develop an indoor navigation app specifically for PFT. Would you use it?

22:23:32
Yes, I would be interested.

22:23:53
What might stop you from using it?

22:24:02
If it’s slow or not accurate. Some 3D maps take too long to load or zoom, which can be frustrating.

22:24:38
The room I had trouble finding was 1202. If you enter from the Panera side, you might turn left too early and miss it.

22:25:06
Thank you for participating.

22:25:10
No problem.

22:25:14
Thank you.
