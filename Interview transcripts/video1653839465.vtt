00:00:02.753 --> 00:00:12.753
To stand… first, I wanna record that. What is your role on campus? Are you a student, staff, or visitor?

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.980
Oh, I'm a graduate student.

00:00:18.981 --> 00:00:23.226
How familiar are you with 50?

00:00:23.226 --> 00:00:24.850
till now, I will say I'm not so much familiar with PFT.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Uh, I think I need to explore a bit more to navigate.

00:00:34.015 --> 00:00:36.015
throughout the building.

00:00:36.015 --> 00:00:38.544
Mm-hmm. What types of places do you usually explore or look in the PFD?

00:00:39.244 --> 00:00:50.244
usually I need to go to my department office and and the chairman office.

00:00:50.245 --> 00:00:56.520
Mm-hmm.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.753
Not only that, my advisor is also the chair of the Division of computer science. So we.

00:00:57.711 --> 00:01:06.711
Usually have meeting extra weekly meeting. So I need to go every week to his office for the meeting.

00:01:11.321 --> 00:01:13.321
I see.

00:01:13.322 --> 00:01:15.454
Apart from this, I, uh, need to go to my lab and also the Panera to grab some snacks.

00:01:15.693 --> 00:01:21.693
And… and some classroom if I do have some classes, yeah.

00:01:22.023 --> 00:01:32.023
Okay, how would you describe navigating inside 50? What makes it easy or difficult?

00:01:35.906 --> 00:01:38.906
To navigate inside the PFT.

00:01:38.907 --> 00:01:39.029
Oh, 1st of all, let me share with you my experience.

00:01:39.126 --> 00:01:46.126
So as a newcomer, I will say it's a bit confusing. Everything looks pretty much symmetric.

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:56.050
So, um, most of the times, I get used to get lost in the building, and then I need to follow the number.

00:01:56.438 --> 00:02:11.438
So… I didn't know that the whole facility is divided into multiple zone. For example, zone 2, 3, 0, zone 2100. So there are multiple zones. So I didn't know that.

00:02:12.348 --> 00:02:24.348
So, after… So many days I figured out, okay, so there are three or four buildings or zone. I need to figure out the zone. Then, based on the zone, then I need to figure out the room number.

00:02:24.818 --> 00:02:28.818
Uh, that I would like to go. Yeah, it was very confusing.

00:02:29.238 --> 00:02:38.238
Yeah, as you mentioned, it's confusing. Can you describe a specific event or time when you try had trouble?

00:02:41.551 --> 00:02:46.551
Finding a room or office inside PFD.

00:02:46.551 --> 00:02:55.520
Well, um… There are, um… Okay, so I'm going to share with you 4 cases. The 1st case is.

00:02:56.431 --> 00:03:03.431
I had a class. So this was my first day at Lsu. So I tried to find the room number.

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:08.729
So it was very difficult. It was on the ground floor.

00:03:09.398 --> 00:03:13.398
Uh, probably in zone… I mean, the first zone probably.

00:03:13.083 --> 00:03:27.083
So it took a lot of time to find out the room. Second thing is finding the departmental office. This is the first thing I needed to do after coming to the PhD.

00:03:28.326 --> 00:03:36.326
So it is quite difficult. I couldn't figure out by myself. I needed help from my advisor to find out where.

00:03:36.327 --> 00:03:54.657
Room is. And third one is the lab, and also the restrooms. Sometimes I find it fairly difficult to figure out the restrooms and the exit plan. So when I see the exit sign, it shows that, okay, I expect that, okay, so there will be somewhere.

00:03:55.015 --> 00:04:07.015
nearby exit plan, but actually it's not. It directs me to like so many ways to go to find out the exit plan.

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:22.539
Alright, so… where did you start? Um, like, you become confused in the hallways or changing the floors, or any specific area that seems confusing.

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:29.150
Um, changing the floor is fine, but in the hallway, yeah.

00:04:29.257 --> 00:04:32.257
The hallway is kind of, like, confusing to us.

00:04:32.521 --> 00:04:39.521
Yeah. So how did you feel in that moment when you faced such a situation?

00:04:40.728 --> 00:04:55.728
Oh, it feels like so sometimes if I'm. So when I'm running out of time. So when I see that I don't have enough time, then it feels really, really tense.

00:04:59.561 --> 00:05:01.561
Hmm.

00:05:01.562 --> 00:05:14.593
And when I have time, then it's fine. Okay, so somehow I figured out I have lots of time. But if I don't have time, it's it's really very intense moment for me. So you know that, uh… tennis were precious and I need to go there in time. Yeah.

00:05:14.778 --> 00:05:24.778
Mm-hmm. So, when you cannot find a particular location inside PFT, what you usually do.

00:05:31.249 --> 00:05:33.249
Um…

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.502
Did you ask someone for help, or did you use any sign any maps?

00:05:41.151 --> 00:05:43.151
Phone for searching, anything?

00:05:43.151 --> 00:05:48.634
Oh, I tried my phone, but it didn't work out, and I usually don't ask people for the navigation at all.

00:05:49.306 --> 00:05:59.306
most of the times I look at the sign and the number and other things try to figure out the way to go there.

00:06:00.383 --> 00:06:11.383
Um… So probably I asked 2 or 3 times, I would say. So it's very rare. Yeah.

00:06:11.515 --> 00:06:26.515
Okay. So what parts of Pft do you feel that it's slower or slower or most confusing areas to navigate like room numbering, or signage?

00:06:31.156 --> 00:06:34.156
Or everything looking similar to you?

00:06:34.157 --> 00:06:38.325
First of all, everything looks similar, um, to me.

00:06:39.204 --> 00:06:52.204
For example, if I sometimes I find it really difficult. Which one is the front side? Which one is the back side? Which one is the left? Which one is the right? Everything looks symmetric.

00:06:52.205 --> 00:06:53.320
Mm-hmm.

00:06:53.320 --> 00:07:00.457
Right? Yeah. So in that case, what cues help you most when navigating?

00:07:02.192 --> 00:07:14.192
What keywords are generally, like, physical queues that are present now? What… such skills help you, like room numbers or directional signs, landmarks.

00:07:18.333 --> 00:07:20.333
maps.

00:07:20.333 --> 00:07:30.748
Um, I'm not sure, is there anything, like, north-south zone, or something like this? I'm not sure about it, but it would be better to have something like this, like this, a North Purd is the south bird, the east or west bird.

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:36.810
That might help to navigate, that might help to understand, okay, where I am.

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:36.955
Mm-hmm.

00:07:37.345 --> 00:07:41.345
in right now. Um… yeah.

00:07:42.177 --> 00:07:55.177
Yeah, so on the next question I want to ask is that do you have any preference on navigating buildings like I want to use elevator or stairs.

00:07:54.535 --> 00:08:02.535
Shortest path, avoiding crowded areas, or when you're carrying heavy objects.

00:08:04.409 --> 00:08:11.409
Yeah, obviously, when incurring heavy objects, and I would definitely prefer for elevator, not the extra case.

00:08:11.881 --> 00:08:18.881
And other thing that probably it would be better to have a system like.

00:08:18.764 --> 00:08:28.764
a virtual reality dev staff. So where I'm in right now, so far should I navigate instead of just like saying, go to right, go to left or.

00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:42.010
Mm-hmm.

00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:45.160
Um, go straight. For one minute, or for 10 feet, something like this. So I would say this is useful, but it would be much more useful if you if I have a system like.

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:53.540
having some sort of virtual reality. So where I'm in right now, so how should I navigate? So visual things.

00:08:54.176 --> 00:09:01.176
Make, uh, the overall experience much better than having some kind of like textual navigational stuff.

00:09:03.073 --> 00:09:17.073
Okay, have you ever struggled to find an accessible route, like… Elevate or, um, automating doors, emergency exit, like, for accessible preferences.

00:09:16.759 --> 00:09:24.759
Um, yeah. So finding out where is the elevator is kind of difficult for me.

00:09:24.638 --> 00:09:29.638
I'm sure I would say, for example, there is a push button that.

00:09:29.666 --> 00:09:36.666
But Marton, you should press to open the lift or call the lift. So on my first day, I couldn't figure it out.

00:09:40.873 --> 00:09:42.873
Mm-hmm.

00:09:42.873 --> 00:09:43.822
So that's pretty strange. But the Ux was not so good, I would say. Yeah.

00:09:43.911 --> 00:09:59.911
Yeah. So, now I am talking about the, like, normal system, normal digital navigation system that is used in outdoors, like Google Maps or Apple, as a pedestrian, do you use such apps?

00:10:03.238 --> 00:10:07.238
Yeah, so what do you like about that system?

00:10:07.239 --> 00:10:07.343
Yeah, definitely.

00:10:15.859 --> 00:10:17.859
Mm-hmm.

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:20.920
Um, for the navigational perspective. Yeah, that way they navigate. That way they show the traffic. That way they show the shortest path that I can follow.

00:10:24.928 --> 00:10:26.928
Mm-hmm.

00:10:26.929 --> 00:10:33.339
And also some sort of like interesting information. For example, this road is clogged or this road is under construction, kind of like this. So it's very important.

00:10:33.049 --> 00:10:41.049
Okay. Would you use a digital indoor navigation system if we build for PFT?

00:10:41.897 --> 00:10:53.897
Oh, why not? I mean, it'll be great, especially the building, like… you know, there are lots of wounds, everything, but we don't know where it is exactly is.

00:10:54.242 --> 00:11:02.242
So having such kind of navigational system definitely. would be very much beneficial for us, yeah.

00:11:01.943 --> 00:11:10.943
Yeah, so… Um, can you tell a scenario that when or what might stop you?

00:11:14.959 --> 00:11:18.959
from using these digital indoor navigational system?

00:11:18.959 --> 00:11:23.341
You're asking when… to stop this digital navigational system, am I right?

00:11:23.341 --> 00:11:24.435
Ew. Awesome.

00:11:23.775 --> 00:11:44.775
Well, um… Ours, um… especially when when I will learn all the corners of in the building. I know where everything is located in the building, and there is no point of using this navigational thing. But.

00:11:45.146 --> 00:11:51.146
Definitely, for the newcomers, the freshmen, it would be really, really helpful for them.

00:11:51.907 --> 00:12:02.907
So those were all the questions I have in my mind. Is there anything else you would like to add for our system?

00:12:04.377 --> 00:12:11.377
I would say, um… That would be really great if you can come up with a very good navigational system.
