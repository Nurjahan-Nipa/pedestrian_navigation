00:00:09.097 --> 00:00:11.097
Thank you for joining, shall we start?

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.840
Yeah, sure.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.059
Okay. Um,  what's your role on campus?

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.640
Are you a student, faculty or visitor?

00:00:18.641 --> 00:00:19.403
I'm a graduate student? Yeah.

00:00:18.969 --> 00:00:20.969
Oh, sorry to interrupt.

00:00:21.326 --> 00:00:23.326
No, that's… okay.

00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:25.333
I was told then, uh, yeah.

00:00:29.448 --> 00:00:34.448
Okay, um, how familiar are you with PFT?

00:00:34.679 --> 00:00:36.679
The PFT building?

00:00:37.558 --> 00:00:42.558
Uh, since I am a second-year graduate student, so, uh,

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:44.759
I know quite places in PFT.

00:00:45.523 --> 00:00:47.523
Okay.

00:00:49.505 --> 00:00:53.505
So what… what kind of places do you usually look for in PFT?

00:00:55.478 --> 00:00:59.478
Hmm… I think Panera for coffee.

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:01.367
Hmm? Nice.

00:01:01.053 --> 00:01:07.053
And uh… sometimes, if I have meeting with my professor, so the faculty lane,

00:01:07.701 --> 00:01:09.701
Okay.

00:01:09.702 --> 00:01:13.099
Um, definitely for a class, classroom, uh, yeah.

00:01:13.801 --> 00:01:16.801
Okay, that's good, nice. And, um… 

00:01:17.524 --> 00:01:21.524
How would you describe the navigating inside the PFT?

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.790
Uh…

00:01:25.528 --> 00:01:36.528
It's quite good, but when I came here at first, it was a little bit confusing, but uh… after, like, spending one year, and now I am getting familiar with the structure, and…

00:01:36.664 --> 00:01:38.664
directions.

00:01:38.664 --> 00:01:42.594
That's good. Okay, can you, uh,

00:01:42.595 --> 00:01:45.242
Can you tell me about, um…

00:01:46.201 --> 00:01:51.201
somewhere when you…  you had, like, trouble to find a room for class or office,

00:01:51.283 --> 00:01:53.283
Uh, when you were in PFT?

00:01:54.634 --> 00:01:57.634
Yeah, I remember that I… as I…

00:01:58.107 --> 00:02:01.107
mentioned earlier about the faculty lane. So,

00:02:00.631 --> 00:02:02.631
Hmm.

00:02:02.632 --> 00:02:08.467
If I'm not wrong, they all have, uh, 3272 lane, but, uh, professors have different…

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:17.830
rooms, which is A, B, C, D. So, it is a little bit difficult, because the whole row is considered as 3272.

00:02:19.271 --> 00:02:21.271
Hmm.

00:02:21.271 --> 00:02:24.626
So, you can't just find one professor's cabin by just using that 3-2

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:32.650
7 to… you have to just see each and every door and check that professor's nameplate to find out that, uh, whose room it is.

00:02:33.751 --> 00:02:35.751
Okay.

00:02:36.335 --> 00:02:39.335
And how much time did it take for you to figure out?

00:02:40.333 --> 00:02:42.333
And…

00:02:42.334 --> 00:02:42.367
the room that you were looking for.

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.310
more than 5 minutes, I guess. I'm very bad at that direction.

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:51.939
That's okay, we all are,  bad in Some… things. 

00:02:53.128 --> 00:02:57.128
So, how did you feel that experience? Obviously, it wasn't good.

00:02:57.435 --> 00:02:59.435
So? 

00:02:59.435 --> 00:02:59.877
Yeah,

00:03:00.856 --> 00:03:04.856
Okay. So, you… you were stopped, um…

00:03:05.954 --> 00:03:07.954
to get… get the rooms, right?

00:03:09.058 --> 00:03:11.058
Okay.

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:15.508
Yeah, sometimes I… because I don't know, and I can't remember that where Professor Sits are. Sometimes, if I…

00:03:15.508 --> 00:03:21.374
need to meet any professor for any meeting or conversation. I cannot just, um, 

00:03:21.872 --> 00:03:24.872
simply go to their place, because they have the numbers,

00:03:25.887 --> 00:03:30.887
The number 3272ABCMN, so it's very difficult, and…

00:03:30.791 --> 00:03:36.791
Uh, it's opposite direction, it's not that all the professors are, uh, sitting at the same place.

00:03:37.038 --> 00:03:41.038
Some are sitting at another side, and a few…

00:03:41.102 --> 00:03:45.102
faculty members that are on our website, so you have to check all the rooms,

00:03:45.258 --> 00:03:47.258
to find out one professor.

00:03:47.818 --> 00:03:53.818
I see, okay. So, uh, whenever you cannot find a location or a room inside PFT,

00:03:53.816 --> 00:03:55.816
What do you usually do?

00:03:57.329 --> 00:03:59.329
And, you know…

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:08.200
sometimes I just check, uh, the professor's room number from their email address or website,

00:04:08.621 --> 00:04:13.621
And there is nothing to do, like, to find it out, because I have to work and…

00:04:13.747 --> 00:04:15.747
take it one by one. Also, I had a hard time finding the water refilling station in PFT, it would be nice if someone mentioned in on the direction board because that helps to find it easily. 

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:17.759
So, yeah.

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.820
Okay. So, do you also ask someone's help?

00:04:22.417 --> 00:04:25.417
Or just check on the maps, or…

00:04:26.571 --> 00:04:28.571
Is that one-time stuff.

00:04:28.572 --> 00:04:31.471
Uh, no, I don't, uh, look in the maps.

00:04:31.472 --> 00:04:37.775
Um, I don't ask people, because I think that they can't also remember where all the professor's sitting, and…

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:39.790
Yeah.

00:04:39.791 --> 00:04:42.782
Okay, so you just… so you just try to…

00:04:43.283 --> 00:04:45.283
find it for yourself. Right?.

00:04:45.284 --> 00:04:45.620
Find by myself. Yeah.

00:04:45.882 --> 00:04:47.882
That's good, yeah, good. 

00:04:50.803 --> 00:04:53.803
And which parts of PFT…

00:04:54.208 --> 00:04:59.208
Do you think is, like, very confusing, or very slow for you to navigate there?

00:05:00.766 --> 00:05:02.766
Uh…

00:05:03.905 --> 00:05:05.905
For navigating, I think…

00:05:05.906 --> 00:05:06.600
Yeah, is it…

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.380
Mm-hmm.

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.297
Yeah, is it the… is it the room numbering, or the sign?

00:05:11.852 --> 00:05:20.852
for the flow transitions, or… and… and what, like, the stairs, elevators, like, which part do you find more confusing in PFT?

00:05:21.842 --> 00:05:25.842
Sometimes finding stairs is a little bit hassle, because, uh,

00:05:25.557 --> 00:05:27.557
Hmm.

00:05:27.557 --> 00:05:35.706
It is showing that, okay, it's on the right side, but sometimes I don't find it on right side, so I'm a bit confused, and because of the door as well,

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:46.280
Like, a similar kind of doors of laps and stairs, and there is no any sign, but it is, like, they have mentioned that it's on the right side, but sometimes I don't find it on right side but left side.

00:05:47.237 --> 00:05:49.237
Okay.

00:05:49.763 --> 00:05:51.763
Okay.

00:05:52.457 --> 00:05:54.457
I see. That might seem like a huge task when you are in a hurry. 

00:05:54.854 --> 00:06:02.854
And uh… yeah, that's the most confusing thing, uh, as you mentioned. But there should be something that helps you. 

00:06:03.566 --> 00:06:09.566
What are the things that help you in navigating? Is it the room numbers, or the direction signs?

00:06:10.192 --> 00:06:14.192
Or do you have some landmarks, or do you just ask people for help?

00:06:19.824 --> 00:06:21.824
Mm-hmm.

00:06:21.825 --> 00:06:21.971
Uh, each and every time I just, uh, look at the board, they have hang-up, uh, with the yellow sign thing.

00:06:22.227 --> 00:06:25.227
So, yeah, it's a little bit helpful, uh…

00:06:25.569 --> 00:06:29.569
I follow… I try to follow their direction, and then I look by myself.

00:06:31.078 --> 00:06:33.078
Okay, that's good. Okay, thank you.

00:06:33.423 --> 00:06:35.423
And, um…

00:06:36.645 --> 00:06:42.645
Do you have, uh, any specific preferences when you're navigating inside the building?

00:06:42.645 --> 00:06:46.176
Do you usually take the elevators, or stairs, or…

00:06:46.179 --> 00:06:48.179
How do you try to do it?

00:06:49.134 --> 00:06:52.134
I mean, do you avoid the crowded areas, or…?

00:06:53.041 --> 00:07:00.041
you know, try to look for, okay, this is the shortest part, this is the easiest part for me to get to someplace inside the building. How do you do it?

00:07:00.642 --> 00:07:06.642
Yeah, sometimes I take shortcut, because, for example, my lab

00:07:07.068 --> 00:07:09.068
is on the side of Panera.

00:07:09.291 --> 00:07:11.291
So, there is a, uh…

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:16.950
lived at the end of that lens, so if I am not taking the whole, uh…

00:07:18.338 --> 00:07:25.338
The Caps 10 gallery, I can just take a shortcut to take that lift, and it will just directly

00:07:25.443 --> 00:07:27.443
lead me to the Panera, so…

00:07:27.444 --> 00:07:30.630
It's convenient for me. Sometimes I take that shortcut.

00:07:31.746 --> 00:07:33.746
Okay, that's good.

00:07:37.288 --> 00:07:45.288
And… have you… have you ever struggled to find the accessible route inside the PFD, like…

00:07:45.639 --> 00:07:49.639
Maybe the elevator, or the automatic door that, okay, where is this thing?

00:07:50.759 --> 00:07:53.759
Uh, yeah, I think, uh, uh…

00:07:53.976 --> 00:07:57.976
Well, we have, uh, faced that thing with the push and pull thing.

00:07:58.853 --> 00:08:04.853
So, yeah, sometimes it's confusing. Some doors have, like, uh… I don't understand it, it should push or pull.

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:07.160
And what do you do…

00:08:07.772 --> 00:08:10.772
when you… when you have struggled like this to find…

00:08:10.799 --> 00:08:12.799
the elevators or doors.

00:08:14.629 --> 00:08:16.629
Okay.

00:08:16.629 --> 00:08:16.739
I try both, and then it works.

00:08:18.219 --> 00:08:20.219
Okay.

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:22.240
And uh…

00:08:23.106 --> 00:08:26.106
What do you think that as a pedestrian, like,

00:08:26.568 --> 00:08:32.568
Uh, do you use any digital navigation system outdoor? Not in the PFT, like, outdoor?

00:08:33.477 --> 00:08:38.477
Uh, of PFT, do you use Google Maps or Apple Maps or some other maps?

00:08:38.477 --> 00:08:40.361
For navigation outdoors.

00:08:40.362 --> 00:08:50.436
Yeah, definitely, definitely. I use a Google Maps to go to each and every places of LSU, so yes, I do it, but inside, I don't know if there is any app or not.

00:08:53.345 --> 00:08:56.345
Without outside, I use Google Map.

00:08:58.282 --> 00:09:01.282
Okay, that's great. I think, yes, most of us use Google Maps.

00:09:01.307 --> 00:09:03.307
Yeah.

00:09:03.308 --> 00:09:06.247
Or maybe Apple Maps. Okay, you use Google Maps. That's good.

00:09:06.247 --> 00:09:06.432
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:09.830
And I hope that helps, right? Unlike…

00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:11.230
Yeah.

00:09:11.231 --> 00:09:11.972
inside the PFT building.

00:09:12.951 --> 00:09:15.951
But it… sometimes it doesn't show you the shortcut.

00:09:16.577 --> 00:09:20.577
And, uh, when you will reach at the place, and you will figure out, okay, I can

00:09:20.577 --> 00:09:24.367
Uh, I could take that away, it would be easier, but yeah.

00:09:25.583 --> 00:09:31.583
Okay, and what do you like about Google Maps? Because you said you use that.

00:09:32.463 --> 00:09:35.463
Mm-hmm. I, uh, like…

00:09:35.463 --> 00:09:38.477
Because it gives an estimation of time.

00:09:38.478 --> 00:09:40.279
Hmm?

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:45.317
How long it will take to work there, if you have time, you can go there. Otherwise, you just can, uh…

00:09:45.717 --> 00:09:48.717
Avoided petroat or something.

00:09:49.677 --> 00:09:52.677
Yeah, I like the timing thing, and yeah.

00:09:53.957 --> 00:09:55.957
And it's… the route is already short, so yeah.

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:58.240
Okay, that's nice.

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:03.240
Um, and if you… if you are given, uh,

00:10:03.495 --> 00:10:07.495
digital indoor navigation for PFT. Would you like to use it?

00:10:07.884 --> 00:10:09.884
Definitely, I will use it.

00:10:12.015 --> 00:10:14.015
That's awesome. And, uh…

00:10:15.909 --> 00:10:21.909
And what could be the possible, uh, things that might stop you from… from using…

00:10:22.473 --> 00:10:27.473
the digital indoor navigation system, could it be related to…

00:10:28.417 --> 00:10:33.417
accuracy, battery, or some extra effort, or something that you have to do, like,

00:10:33.311 --> 00:10:35.311
What do you think might stop you?

00:10:36.115 --> 00:10:38.115
Uh, if it…

00:10:38.996 --> 00:10:42.996
needs internet, that can be, like, it should be, uh…

00:10:44.063 --> 00:10:50.063
not, like, a hosted in online, uh, so that you can use it if we are offline or somewhere.

00:10:50.087 --> 00:10:54.087
something. And another thing, probably, um…

00:10:54.507 --> 00:10:57.507
I won't use, uh…

00:10:57.508 --> 00:11:00.002
If it, uh, uh…

00:11:00.063 --> 00:11:03.063
texts each and every time to sign in.

00:11:03.648 --> 00:11:05.648
Like, if… yeah.

00:11:07.902 --> 00:11:11.902
if I have to sign in each and every time while using the app, that would be…

00:11:12.012 --> 00:11:21.012
Because I… if I am in rush, I have to sign in… like, I have to log in each and every time, giving the credential. It won't, like, recognize my…

00:11:21.527 --> 00:11:24.527
credential, so it's… it's a bit.

00:11:25.027 --> 00:11:35.027
tiring, I guess, and some app give… will give you the verification code. You have to verify it to use that, so it's a little bit time-consuming.

00:11:35.824 --> 00:11:37.824
Otherwise, I'm good to use any app.

00:11:37.864 --> 00:11:39.864
of whichever will be helpful.

00:11:41.243 --> 00:11:45.243
Okay, that's great. Yeah, I hope we can try to make something that helps.

00:11:47.413 --> 00:11:49.413
Mm-hmm. 

00:11:49.413 --> 00:11:50.866
to build something useful. Okay, so these, these were my questions, uh…

00:11:52.377 --> 00:12:00.377
And thank you so much, uh, for your time and for taking this interview. So, is there anything else that you would like to share about navigation?

00:12:00.335 --> 00:12:04.335
inside PFT, like, anything that we couldn't discuss here.

00:12:04.871 --> 00:12:06.871
Mm-hmm, uh, so…

00:12:07.087 --> 00:12:09.087
You are welcome for this.

00:12:10.461 --> 00:12:12.461
questionnaire, and I think, uh…

00:12:12.754 --> 00:12:21.754
If you guys build something, uh, there will be definitely a shortcut of the search thing. I hope that, and I…

00:12:22.306 --> 00:12:24.306
Believe that you will have that one.

00:12:25.225 --> 00:12:29.225
Uh, so… so that we can just identify that specific…

00:12:29.403 --> 00:12:32.403
Place. And have navigation.

00:12:32.646 --> 00:12:34.646
Uh, and… yeah.

00:12:34.934 --> 00:12:37.934
Uh, I think you guys have already done well, and…

00:12:38.253 --> 00:12:41.253
included all the questions and concerns.

00:12:41.339 --> 00:12:47.339
So, yeah, just… if I get to use that thing, then I can review

00:12:48.204 --> 00:12:53.204
Bad thing, but yeah, for now, I think it will be a great project. So, best of luck to all of you.

00:12:54.437 --> 00:12:57.437
Well, thank you so much. Thank you so much for your time.

00:12:57.366 --> 00:12:59.366
You are welcome.

00:12:59.366 --> 00:13:00.894
Yeah, and that's all for myself, yeah, thank you.
